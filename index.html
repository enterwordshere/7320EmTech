		I am starting this website as a visual guide to the learning process of Emerging Technologies. It is my hope that the skills I learn while making these products can be transferred to my experience within a library. Some of these projects were realtively easy, while others took mountains of time. In all cases, I have had fun and I hope to continue learning and trying new things.

		<figcaption><b>Technology:</b> Adobe Premiere Pro
		<br>
		<b>Goal:</b> To record and edit a video using multiple cameras from different angles.
		<br>
		<b>Final results & thoughts: </b>The recording devices could have been chosen better, but overall I really enjoyed this project. I did have a couple issues with a camera failing and then getting the audio lined up, but I managed to make it work. In terms of application, this could go a couple different ways. First, it could be used as a way for librarians to showcase various check out materials. While the librarian discusses how the object works, they can also walk through the processes on screen. In addition, the main screen could be swapped out with any number of activities while a librarian discusses current events in the library or current topics within the field. Including the small video of the speaker allows for the video to be more personable, which libraries strive to be.

		Twine
		<br>
		<b>Goal: </b> To experiment with branching stories and coding with a specialized language.
		<br>
		<b>Final results & thoughts: </b> Intially, it was quite difficult to manage the effects and aesthetic that I wanted. After a lot of searching, however, I was able to complete my project. Although there is documentation  for each of the main coding options, many of the things I attempted didn't actually work. In addition, there were several situations that I believed were common, that the documentation did not mention. In terms of application, I believe that there are two main lessons applicable to librarianship. First, the concept of branching stories or games could be useful as a tool for patrons. It could be used casually, but also as a way to improve logical thought processing. Second, many library tools allow for the use of code such as Libguides. Although the coding used within Twine is different from general HTML and CSS, it does provide a casual outlet for learning the basics of coding logic.

		<b>Technology:</b> 
		Canva
		<br>
		<b>Goal:</b> To create a resume using design tools rather than a word processor. 
		<br>
		<b>Final results & thoughts: </b>Overall, I like the way that the resume turned out. I like being able to use colors, and I like the addition of a photo. In practice, however, I do not believe I would ever use a resume like this. A photo on a resume seems counter intuitive while trying to highlight your skills, because it then provides unnecissary information about your background that could negatively affect your chances of securing an interview. In addition, while the color might look good to me, it could cumbersom to hiring commitees that prefer black and white both for viewing and for printing. Despite these reservations, Cavna as a tool would be excellent for creating other documents such as fliers or infographics. The website was easy to use, but allowed for a vast array of customization.

		 <b>Technology:</b> 
		  Logitech Capture
		<br>
		<b>Goal:</b> To practice creating a screen recorded walkthrough of a research related tool using a free program.
		<br>
		<b>Final results & thoughts: </b> I have used Camtasia previously, but I wanted to test a free program. My favorite feature was not used in this project, but the program allows for simultaneous recording from a webcam as well as the screen. The interface is simple with limited settings, but a user can choose from different screen layouts. Although it lacks the ability to do much else besides simple recording, this could be seen as a positive for those who are not tech savy. Screen recordings are perfect for creating walkthroughs and tutorials of web based services for the library. I do like the simple interface, but for librarians who are willing to learn something a little bit more complex, I would recommend Flashback Express. The program takes up a little less space on the computer, but offers the same features in addition to more customization in terms of recording. Overall, I think that Logitech Capture would be perfect for those who like to keep things simple, but some librarians would benefit from choosing a program such as Flashback Express as it offers more options for the same prize (free!).

			<b>Technology:</b> 
			Python
		<br>
		<b>Goal:</b> To learn the basics of Python as it is a language often used in data mining. 
		<br>
		<b>Final results & thoughts: </b>
				When I initially began this project, I wanted to learn more about data mining. I have heard of reserachers using Python to pull data from websites as well as mining citations or documents. When I attempted to find out more, however, I hit several deadends. There is a multitude of pages that [talk about datamining and some that discuss specfic situation, but I never found anything that actually worked] [Although I did want to learn, I didn't think that this would be an effective way to learn something complex] [Note that I didn't want to give up, because I thought that learning some general syntax and how the thing works would have been beneficial] [Overall, I think that I did succeed in learning the things that I can then expand upon later]

		<b>Goal:</b> To create a digital portfolio of sorts to display the products of my endeavors and reflect upon what I have learned.
		<br>
		<b>Final results & thoughts: </b> 
			 [I decided to go with coding the web instead of using a web builder, because I had already used a web builder and didn't feel like it would give me the type of lessons I wanted][early on I decided that I wanted to make it cumulative] [Mention that I had previous experience with html and css, but hadn't used DW][Talk about how I had to use a lot of different resources despite the simplicity of the final product.] [Mention something about the specific of dw and how it was super helpful] [Final note that I learned a lot about html and Css, but also learned that i enjoy the process of portfolio creating. It is exciting to see everything come together]
